<h4>Captain Yves Vandenborn, FNI</h4>
<p>Hon. President<br />The Nautical Institute (Singapore)</p>
<p>Yves Vandenborn is a master mariner and sailed with Exmar Nv. Belgium on chemical/product, LNG and LPG tankers. Since coming ashore in 2003, Yves has worked as a marine superintendent and as an independent marine surveyor undertaking numerous P&amp;I condition surveys, oil major SIRE pre-vettings, TMSA audits, pre-purchase surveys, bulk carrier hatch cover ultra-sonic tests, etc.</p>
<p>Yves joined The Standard Club in February 2010 as an in-house marine surveyor based in Singapore. In July 2013 he took over as Director of Loss Prevention for The Standard Club. As the director he is responsible for the risk assessment programme for the club&rsquo;s membership worldwide. He is further responsible for the club&rsquo;s loss prevention initiatives, publications and technical advice to the membership, as well as to the underwriting and claims departments.</p>
<p>Yves regularly speaks at shipping industry events across the world on behalf of The Standard Club. He uses his vast personal experience to explain serious issues in a way that is interesting and relevant to the audience. He uses anecdotes and lessons learnt from his sailing career to illustrate best practice guidelines, making him a welcome fixture at many speaking engagements.</p>
<p>In line with his beliefs of giving back to the industry, Yves is currently closely engaged in maritime discourse topics such as seafarer wellbeing (physical, mental, and social), misdeclared container cargoes, vehicle car carrier fires and navigation related incidents.</p>
<p>Yves is a Fellow of the Nautical Institute and became the Hon President of the Nautical Institute Singapore branch in 2020. In this capacity, Yves works closely with the local maritime industry for the improvement of seafarer standards, safety and wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>
